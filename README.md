## by Ezulu Priscilla Chinwendu


## Dataset

> This data set includes information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area.


## Summary of Findings

In the exploration, a notable finding emerged indicating an inverse relationship between ride duration and age. This suggests that as age increases, ride duration tends to decrease. Additionally, a distinct pattern was observed in ride frequency, with a higher number of rides occurring on weekdays compared to weekends. Moreover, the majority of rides took place during peak hours between 7am and 7pm.

Further analysis revealed that individuals identifying as 'Other' gender exhibited higher average ride durations compared to other gender categories. Additionally, customers tended to have longer ride durations on average compared to subscribers. These findings provide valuable insights into the relationship between ride duration and demographic factors, such as age, gender, and user type.

## Key Insights for Presentation

1. Inverse Relationship: Ride duration showed an inverse relationship with age, indicating that younger individuals tend to opt for longer rides compared to older individuals.

2. Weekday Dominance: Rides were predominantly taken on weekdays, especially on Thursdays and Fridays, suggesting higher demand during the workweek.

3. Peak Hours: Most rides occurred during the rush hours of 7am to 7pm, indicating the service's popularity for daily commuting.

4. Short Ride Durations: The majority of rides were relatively short, with durations ranging from 300 to 1200 seconds, indicating the service's usage for quick trips or immediate transportation needs.

5. Customer vs. Subscriber: Customers had higher average ride durations compared to subscribers, highlighting potential differences in usage patterns between the two user types.

These key insights provide a concise overview of the analysis findings, focusing on the relationship between ride duration and age, ride patterns on weekdays and during peak hours, the distribution of ride durations, and the distinction between customer and subscriber behavior.









These findings shed light on the distribution of ride durations, the temporal patterns of ride activity, and the distinction in trip durations between customer and subscriber segments.
